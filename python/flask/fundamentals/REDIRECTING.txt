::REDIRECTING::

- Can't render on a POST. Doing that will duplicate your data in your application
- how do we navigate? We redirect within our servers by using a method called 
redirect that we can use as a function.

- redirecting is when we perform a GET request on teh clients behalf. This will now be the 
request that is completed should the client refresh the page.
