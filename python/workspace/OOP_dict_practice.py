#* KEY VALUE PAIR DATA STRUCTURES | Common Format for Data-Interchange

#*key structure pair structures are often used for data coming from other sources, even
#*external programs written in different languages typically written in JSON using an API. 
#*which can be parsed with python dictionaries. When using the Flask framework this is how to
#*retrieve data.

#*comparing dictionaries to OOP classes.

#TODO DICTIONARIES: 
#TODO 1. have unique keys for stored values
#TODO 2. have access to many pieces of data through a single dictionary using a key
#TODO 3. can add new key value pairs to an existing dictionary. This is flexible but
#TODO doesn't fit data that should be in uniform.
#TODO 4. Can store functions but does not inherently share within other dictionaries.


#! OOP CLASSES:
#! 1. have you unique attributes stored in data
#! 2. have access to many attribute values through a single object instance using an
#! attribute name.
#! 3. Generally cannot add new attributes to an existing object instance.
#! Keeps data uniform but has little capacity for non-uniform data.
#! 4. A class can have instance methods that are shared with all instances.
